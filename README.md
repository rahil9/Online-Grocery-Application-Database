# Online Grocery Application Database

## Introduction
This project is an Online Grocery Application Database aimed at providing a seamless experience for customers to browse, purchase, and receive groceries conveniently. The database is designed to efficiently manage various entities involved in the process, including customers, products, orders, payments, shipping, admins, inventory, sellers, categories, and reviews.

## Entities

### 1. Customers
Customers are the end-users of the application. They can browse products, add them to their carts, place orders, and provide reviews.

### 2. Categories
Categories classify products into different groups based on their characteristics or purposes. They help in organizing and navigating through the vast range of available products.

### 3. Products
Products represent the items available for purchase in the application. Each product belongs to a specific category and has attributes such as name, description, price, and quantity.

### 4. Orders
Orders represent the transactions made by customers. They contain information about the products purchased, quantities, total price, shipping details, and payment status.

### 5. Reviews
Reviews are feedback provided by customers regarding the products they have purchased. They help other customers make informed decisions and provide valuable insights for sellers and administrators.

### 6. Payments
Payments represent the financial transactions associated with orders. They include payment methods, transaction IDs, and payment statuses.

### 7. Shipping
Shipping encompasses the process of delivering orders to customers. It includes details such as shipping addresses, delivery status, tracking information, and shipping methods.

### 8. Admins
Admins are users responsible for managing and maintaining the application. They have privileges to add or remove products, manage orders, monitor reviews, and perform other administrative tasks.

### 9. Inventory
Inventory represents the stock of products available for sale. It tracks the quantity of each product and ensures that stock levels are updated accurately based on sales and restocking activities.

### 10. Sellers
Sellers are entities or individuals who supply products to the application. They manage their product listings, prices, and inventory levels.
